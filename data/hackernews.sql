Developing countries that embraced free trade (see Africa, South America) largely remain poor today while countries that embraced protectionism (see Asia) are much wealthier. The basic fact here is that industrial societies need to be bootstrapped by a strong, active government (who can defend native industries and provide financing in the form of fiat currency) and rampant copying by those native industries (who have no legacy investments and can jump straight to best-of-breed practices and the latest technologies). None of this is a new idea: it was all laid out by Friedrich List almost 200 years ago. Unfortunately the basic idea, despite the mountains of empirical evidence, fell to the onslaught of \"free trade\" propaganda.<p>What\'s interesting is that the same basic dynamic likely applies to even highly developed economics.

Yes, countries have certainly sped up their development through the use of tariffs.  By transferring money from consumers to people accumulating capital they increased the effective savings rate of the country and increase growth.  But you can also literally just tax consumers and pass the money on to industrialists in the form of cheap loans like the Japanese did in their development.  They didn\'t go off the gold standard until the Great Depression but I\'m sure you could industrialize through fiat currency too though no cases come immediately to mind.<p>I\'m not entirely happy telling current poor countries \"Suffer now so your grandchildren can be rich\" even it that\'s what my ancestors did for me.

The libraries definitely should be fixed, and adding the multiplication step is really a simple and fast change for a great benefit.<p>As an inspiration, Kernighan and Ritchie in their book about C used a simple number 31, and that simple hash is still quite good compared to much more complex and more recent solutions as K&R also haven\'t used the (I guess misleadingly named) \"open addressing\" for their hash table.

The downside is that it\'s not possible for a type to implement a custom hash that takes particular advantage of its own structure, and so to get a particularly good tradeoff of distribution against performance. The only place to make that tradeoff is in the choice of Hasher, where it has to be made generically across all types.<p>That said, you can choose the hasher used for individual HashMaps, so if you have a HashMap where you know the keys are integers, you can use a Hasher which just does a Fibonacci hash.', NULL, NULL, NULL),

Again though, it\'s a fairly loose system. In theory the load is pretty well distributed across the truck\'s numbered shelves by the planning system... except all the days that it isn\'t.

Using the analogy between the packages transported in the network and the packets transmitted through the Internet, a package in a public logistics network could, for example, be sent from a retail store and then routed through a sequence of public distribution centers (DCs) located throughout the metropolitan area and then delivered to a customer\'s home in a matter of hours, making a car trip to the store to get the package unnecessary.

Since existing automation technologies do not provide the flexibility needed to allow any size load to move to any location at anytime, a new DC design has been developed that would allow packages of varying size to be automatically unloaded at a DC, sorted, stored, and then loaded onto an outbound truck.

Maybe someone with a CTO\'s ear, or maybe you\'re an unusually empathetic CTO.<p>In any case you\'re clearly at the point where you\'ve had the internal discussions, the trigger has been assembled and is ready to pull, and you and/or the team (committee?) has probably already been groomed by all the gigantic providers\' sales teams, which of course pull out all the stops in your case. If I understand these things correctly, if you haven\'t yet had an amazing lunch or two on one or more vendors\' dimes, you will :) (or at least the high-level people will, would be nice if you get included).<p>Sales is important. But always remember, particularly for large potential accounts like yours, the sales numbers will always be what the high-level execs want them to be, and the sales teams will be spinning the story the execs want to hear. The on-the-ground experience is always going to be rough. You\'ve probably experienced similar transitions, and that\'s what\'s informing your skepticism some of your team won\'t have jobs. Nice you\'re giving your people some thought.<p>On the one hand, it doesn\'t really matter who you sign up with, as vendor ceases to matter somewhat short of the $B mark.<p>On the other hand, try to mitigate the risk of discovering that a vendor can\'t provide a given feature at some eleventh hour, or you may end up in a confused tangle of AWS and GCE deployments (because the other major vendor will of course have the missing feature, and the fragmentation will begin).<p>How I\'d achieve this: every time you go \"ok, so this is our implementation blueprint\", start the rounds of internal technical enumeration over again. Spend time with the engineers to understand pain points. Talk to as many people on the ground as possible, especially the forgotten people in the corners. One-on-ones, or small groups of people who are known to gel well with each other (no impedance mismatches, work well together), could be good for extricating annoying gotchas. This could look like devs aimlessly paging through source code and saying what they think (this could catch tiny things well), or it might be more structured with general architectural discussion.<p>Do NOT have the cloud provider vendors do this work (of talking to your existing team); I wouldn\'t be surprised if they offer to do it, but if they do, all their feedback ultimately goes to the sales guys (via an internal engineer digestion process), and not directly to you.<p>Well, the analysis team will probably generate a high-level report that contains all the information they\'ve discovered (this is probably legally mandated for full disclosure about what they now know), but all the on-the-ground details about inefficiencies, vendor-specific pain points and so forth will only be derived by vendor-internal engineering debriefs, and you\'ll naturally never get any of this particularly valuable information - unfortunately this approach is within the vendors\' business focus, as inefficiency means more compute resources used ($), and pain points mean more vendor-infrastructure maintenance ($). You could respin this statement to say that the vendor who makes the most attractive offer is the one who knows their system is the worst fit for your system, but I don\'t know :)<p>Instead, if you don\'t have the internal resources (or freshness/objectivity) to put together a bird\'s-eye view, get an outside consultancy to help, directing them to investigate your current architecture top-to-bottom-and-back-to-top-again, and advise on ways the system can be rearchitected for efficiency and optimization within modern cloud infrastructure. (They\'d then be the ones doing the one-on-ones and so forth I mentioned above.)<p>Another thing that may be extremely useful would be to take the \"we\'re moving to the cloud traction\" and carefully smudge out (some of) the dividing line between \"we\'re overhauling everything to migrate it and make it work most efficiently within $vendor\" and \"we\'re rearchitecting major components so they work more efficiently overall\" so the line between these two sentiments is blurred, and both things wind up happening in lockstep. Obviously the two ideas are intrinsically distinct and this can only be taken so far - \"rewrite everything from scratch to get it running in the cloud\" wouldn\'t pass <i>any</i> accounting costing or time-boxing :) - but you can probably push this far enough to extract some usefulness from it (eg, you probably have an idea how long upper level will be willing to wait for this transition to finish - 2 years? 1 year? 6 months? - and you might be able to squeeze some interesting and useful tidy-up operations into that window).<p>Blurring the lines between these two things will play to your existing devs\' strengths, as rewriting/restructuring is easier on the brain than the \"replace engine in flight\" of picking up all the existing state, punting it into to the cloud ad-hoc, and running after all the resulting fires that get created and scrambling to get it all working perfectly.<p>It won\'t be a perfect transition if you\'re really a $BBB operation, and restructuring will be the easiest way to cohesively get the existing devs into a flexible frame of mind and ready to deal with whatever curveballs get thrown their way.<p>This is one way you could efficiently achieve keeping a lot of your existing team.<p>Plus, restructuring means everything can slowly be built up onto the new system; picking everything up at once and expecting it to land on its feet probably won\'t go very well.<p>Depending on how things go, if you bring in new techs to assist with understanding modern best practice/hitting the ground running, I cannot recommend enough pitting them against your current team when doing onboarding/interviewing, as they\'d be an EXCELLENT catalyst for judging candidates\' character.<p>These are a couple of lateral ways the current workforce could be creatively employed during this time. I reckon careful management would see everyone kept on until retirement.<p>The current team knows all the systems inside out. Letting them go would make everything a thousand times worse.<p>Also, another reason I thought it would be cool to put an email is because your post makes for a perhaps-unwitting but nonetheless effective and interesting recruitment drive; I\'m aware of very few (okay, zero) high-level people at equally high-level companies who really care about their employees.

And this is a pretty subtle point to explain to anyone who has not experienced both cultures significantly. But the MO of studying systems that can be measured in physical reality, is a constraining principle. Mathematics is not constrained to so-called reality and as a result can fly higher and see farther; it has a better imagination, if you will.<p>Burden me not with any reminders about reality, people needing to get up to make the donuts or whatever. I know all that. I\'m not knocking reality, reality\'s great. Nor do I need reminding how beautiful and strange and wild and cool some of the math in physics really can be. Utterly, utterly rad, without a doubt. But working with such high-dimensional spaces, such high-rank/high-variable transformations, and such high-density symbolic representations, as physics seeks to do, requires a much freer and more \"artistic\" approach than some kind of mental slavery to what can be seen. (By which I mean, what can be measured.) Physicists need more pure math, and when I say pure, I actually prefer the term theoretical math. Because physicists need to design their own math, and that is in one sense what theoretical mathematics means.<p>Physicists are better at what laypeople think of as mathematics--huge whiteboards, filled with esoteric symbols, furrowed brows and chalk-stained hands jittering through the air in some magnificent, halting dance of frustration & eureka. That\'s what people think of when they think of \"doing mathematics\". But physicists don\'t really do what mathematicians do, not really, not completely.

The critics (she is surely not the only one) exactly complain that, for example, the \"string theory\" is more math than physics because it can\'t be \"immediately verified\" or they complain that the most of the experiments are \"not confirming\" the most obvious variants of the expected results of the new theory candidates. But the science shouldn\'t be reduced to the short-term goals and only to the processes which are \"guaranteed to work.\" That\'s exactly when we won\'t see further from our noses.<p>And if the critics say that the \"alternative theories\" don\'t get enough funding, I posit that the average \"alternative theories\" are typically even more conservative than what is widely accepted physics (by the virtue of the accepted physics being already \"unintuitive\" enough and having the steeper learning curve than practically all \"alternatives\" are ready to accept).<p>We should all appreciate that one the most impressive achievements of the 20th century physics, the General Theory of Relativity has its fundamental support in the famous Michelson-Morley experiments which also <i>didn\'t confirm</i> the expectations of the 19th century physicists.<p>So we have to achieve enough experimental results against some approaches, and more than that, with enough precision, to even have the chance of finding out the new rules, if the new rules in the form that we\'re used to find them even could be found. We must be open to the experiments, and be happy even when the \"most hoped\" results don\'t happen.<p>On another side, when Sabine Hossenfelder is more precise and when she addresses some specific aspects, I can surely agree with some of her statements, for example:<p>\"The criticism of heliocentrism based on the argument that the absence of observable\nparallax implied the stars had to be \"unnaturally\" far away was wrong for exactly\nthis reason: They had no probability distribution but erroneously postulated one by\nassuming that the stars should be likely to have similar distances to the planets as the\nplanets have among each other. We now understand the distribution of stars and their\ntypical distances comes about dynamically during structure formation and that there\nis nothing \"unnatural\" about the distance of our Sun to the other suns.\"<p>Her criticism, however, is that currently physicists are \"looking for the lost keys under the street lamp\" because \"in the dark they can\'t see them.\" But even if it sounds funny or misguided, it is true that in the dark not much could be seen, and before we actually check the already properly lit areas we can\'t expect more from looking into the dark where we really see too little. Investing in the flashlights can be reasonable, but also only once the lit areas are actually checked.<p>And we should also not forget that the current physics already enlightened immense parts of the universe.

I just find it funny in the context of this article. An alarm clock is the last thing one should use if natural and healthy length of sleep is a priority. I know that society creates the pressure, but just to stay in the context of the article...<p>Myself, I have not used an alarm clock in years and I would rather face huge pay cuts <i>(which is exactly what is happening)</i> or even worse rather than ever go back to forced wake-up, which I would now consider a direct violent attack on my person. Exceptions are fine, but no way I would let that be imposed on me as \"normal part of life\" ever again.<p>By the way, the brain, i.e. its zeitgebers are really good at waking you up.<p>I had to take a chelator (binds to heavy metals in the body and makes them excretable; details are in my recent comment history) regularly (keeping a low steady dose in blood instead of pulse-dosing). It meant waking up every 4 hours at the latest. I soon didn\'t need an alarm clock even for that any more! My brain would wake me up, and it would even take into account my overall health status. When according to my symptoms I had more metals circling I would wake up after maybe 1.5 or 2 hours, when I felt fine I would wake up after 3.8 hours or so, just before the scheduled 4 hour mark. I did that for years, it was completely automatic. Also, when I went off the chelator for a week I would instantly, starting that same following night, sleep through and not wake up! My brain (the zeitgebers) even took into account if I took the chelators and needed to wake up or not. Amazing thing, that brain.<p>After years of my not quite voluntary experiments I trust my brain <i>a lot</i> more when it comes to decisions such as the sleep schedule. It\'s far more fine-tuned and takes into account so much more, it\'s not a blunt regulation at all but highly sophisticated. In my experience, not just with sleep but there\'s more such \"involuntary experiments\" I got into through my heavy metal issue, the brain\'s regulatory circuits not connected to consciousness nevertheless actually <i>do</i> incorporate a lot of information most people might think are for our conscious self only, we just don\'t usually realize it (or trust it). My conclusion is that while the conscious part cannot (easily, directly) access information from the areas outside of consciousness, the opposite is not true and the rest of the brain uses <i>all</i> information. It\'s almost as if my brain always knows what I\'m up to, spooky :-)<p>By the way, in my sleep experience much amplified by the health issues caused by heavy metal poisoning, the first 1-3 hours of sleep and the very last part - the one that many people are missing out on - stand out. When I was at the peak of my (mercury) problems I might be okay all day, but I would wake up between 2 and 3 am knowing with absolute certainty I had cancer, or something really bad. My conscious self knew that was nonsense, at least after a while of observing those patterns, but the feeling was there. Those first 2 or 3 hours also were the ones were my body had the most problems. Everything was fine and nice after that first part of sleep. The last part, hours 6-8 or even just 7-8, stand out because if you wake up just before that you feel fine and fresh, but if you wake up after that part you may actually feel a bit worse. However, and as I said I experienced the effects much amplified because of the specific issues I had at the time, without that last part of sleep something was missing, something.. <i>essential</i>. It was like - and that is not a literal description because I have no idea what my body did! - as if the body had thrown out a ton of \"garbage\" in that very last phase. So if you missed it you might feel better because that \"garbage\" wasn\'t in your blood, but long term it was better to not skip \"garbage duty\". That\'s only my \"by feel\" description!<p>That feeling is similar to what more people may know as what happens when yo have to sleep during the day, and instead of just superficially napping you actually fall into \"real\" sleep. When you wake up you may feel groggy for an hour. With my involuntarily gained experience I would now advise to go through with it, if your body does that it has a reason! I always felt worse short term but much better long term with that very last sleep phase.<p>I went through such phases over almost a decade of recovery, and the more I got better overall, with clinically proven (unexpected) successes, the less my body wanted any of that. I only had the desire to sleep during the day when I really needed it, it got less and less the farther I got overall. So I would not treat the body\'s desire to sleep at any time lightly, even during daytime. Most of your brain involved in regulating your body is not accessible to consciousness, but it has a lot more data and you should think twice if you really want to use the consciousness\' ability to override some things. Instead, isn\'t it reasonable to hand over control to where the data is, i.e. to let such things like sleep pattern not be regulated by alarm clocks and social pressures but by your \"inner self\"?

For me falling asleep has been a difficult assignment that usually takes 1-3 hours. It\'s been a negative feedback loop where when I am tired I lose discipline and stay awake longer, which makes me even more tired the next day, which makes me stay awake even longer. It makes no sense at all and frequently throws me in bouts of grogginess that last days.<p>It\'s been that way for more than ten years now, and I\'ve read and talked a lot about sleeping but nothing ever made me get rid of this problem of not being able to fall asleep. A couple of weeks ago however I read two HN articles that together seem to have finally given me some grip on falling asleep more quickly (i.e. in less than 1 hour).<p>Reading back that last paragraph makes me feel like I\'m about to introduce a \"doctors hate this one trick\" product..

Relax both your muscles, and your mind.<p>I can\'t seem to find the second article, maybe it didn\'t have sleep in the title or something, but it was the missing link for me. The article was a little bit controversial because it had a linkbaity title implying sleep is not important. The main point of that article was that since stress and stressful thinking inhibits sleep, you sleep better if you don\'t worry about sleeping. It\'s the old ice bear problem, you have to sleep, but you\'re not allowed to think about having to sleep.<p>I combined those two articles into a simple strategy that seems to be fairly succesful so far. First step is to get into a position where all my limbs are relaxed, and I actively relax my body.<p>The next step is to stop my mind from racing through the realization and acceptation that the most important thing right now is to sleep. That means that my ideas are unimportant, that my organization of tomorrows tasks are unimportant, that sudden realizations are unimportant, that nothing matters, not even falling asleep. I kill any brain activity with \"it doesn\'t matter\", almost as a mantra. When something pops up in my brain, I force myself to think \"it doesn\'t matter\" and cease working on the idea.<p>Maybe it sounds a bit silly, but I think it might help someone in the same situation as me.
